# AI SDK - GitHub Models

The GitHub Models provider for the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs) gives you access to the [GitHub Models][feature] catalog of large language models, designed for building modern web applications.
GitHub Models has support for multiple model families, like [xAI](https://github.com/marketplace?publisher=xAI&type=models), [OpenAI](https://github.com/marketplace?publisher=OpenAI&type=models) and [Meta](https://github.com/marketplace?publisher=Meta&type=models).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> GitHub Models is currently in pre-release and subject to [GitHub Pre-release License Terms](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-pre-release-license-terms).

To learn more about integrating GitHub Models into your projects, visit the [GitHub Models documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models).

## Setup

The GitHub Models provider is available in the `@github/models` NPM package. You can install it with:

```bash
npm i @github/models
```

## Quick Start

To get started, you'll need a [GitHub PAT (personal access token)](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

```ts
import {githubModels} from '@github/models'
import {generateText} from 'ai'

const result = await generateText({
  model: githubModels('meta/meta-llama-3.1-8b-instruct'),
  prompt: 'Write a haiku about programming.',
})

console.log(result.text)
```

> [!TIP]
> GitHub Models includes [free usage](https://gh.io/models-rate-limits) for all accounts. For higher usage limits, you can opt into [paid usage](https://gh.io/github-models-pricing).

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createGithubModels` from `@github/models` and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import {createGithubModels} from '@github/models'

const githubModels = createGithubModels({
  org: 'my-organization',
})
```
